## 💡 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Species Sequence Comparison
**Goal**: Find genes common and unique to multiple species

**Workflow**:
1. Use sequence comparison tool to compare CDS files from multiple species
2. View common sequences (conserved genes)
3. View unique sequences (species-specific genes)
4. Export results for further analysis

### Scenario 2: Sample Sequence Classification
**Goal**: Classify mixed sequences by sample name

**Workflow**:
1. Use sample classification tool to load mixed FASTA file
2. Program automatically recognizes sample names
3. Export all samples or selectively export some samples
4. Get sample-organized sequence files

### Scenario 3: Complete Analysis Workflow
**Goal**: From multiple species files to sample-organized common genes

**Workflow**:
1. Use sequence comparison tool to compare multiple species files
2. Export common sequences (genes common to all species)
3. Use sample classification tool to load exported common sequences
4. Classify by sample name and export
5. Get sample-organized common gene sequences

## ❓ FAQ

### Q1: What's the difference between the two tools?
**A**: The sequence comparison tool compares multiple files to find common and unique sequences; the sample classification tool classifies sequences in a mixed file by sample.

### Q2: Which FASTA formats are supported?
**A**: Supports standard FASTA format, header starts with ">", sequence starts after new line. Supports .fasta and .fa extensions.

### Q3: Is comparison based on sequence content or header?
**A**: The sequence comparison tool compares based on header names, not sequence content.

### Q4: Can I use it on Mac or Linux?
**A**: Yes, but need to run Python scripts directly:
```bash
python fasta_compare.py
python fasta_classifier.py
```

### Q5: How to check Python version?
**A**: Enter in command line: `python --version`

## 🔍 Sequence Name Recognition Rules

### Sequence Comparison Tool
Program extracts sequence names from headers, removing position information:
- `rps12_join{...}|A10.fasta` → `rps12`
- `psbA_[76:1137](-)` → `psbA`
- `gene_name[some_info]` → `gene_name`

### Sample Classification Tool
Program extracts sample names from end of headers:
- `>gene_name|A10.fasta` → `A10`
- `>sequence|sample1` → `sample1`
- `>name A10.fasta` → `A10`
